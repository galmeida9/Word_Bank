# Japanese Dictionary
I am currently learning japanese on my own, and I wanted to print out some flashcards to train kanji, but instead of wasting paper, I thought why not make an app for that? This app has some key **features**:

* **Japanese dictionary**: you can search words in *english*, *hiragana*, *katakana*, *kanji* and in *romanji*;
* **Word bank**: any word can be added to your word bank, that you can consult and see the hiragana and english translations, also it is possible to delete and consult the definition of any word;
* **Training**: words from the word bank are randomly chosen and if they are in kanji you have to write them, otherwise you have to type their meaning in english;
* **Duolingo data**: it is possible to login into your Duolingo account and import all the learned words;
* **Dark mode**: dark mode is supported and your preference is saved, so the next time you use the app your eyes can be relaxed.

### Releases
You can grab the latest **Windows** executable [here](https://github.com/galmeida9/japanese_dictionary/releases), although a **linux** one is provided, I have yet to test it.
